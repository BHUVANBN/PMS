Integration Pointers (Project-specific)
- Frontend routes: Add HR landing and smart redirects in frontendv2/src/config/routes.js and pages/hr/.
- Deep linking: Handle and persist redirect in auth wrapper (e.g., frontendv2/src/components/auth/AuthGate.jsx).
- Personalization storage: Save HR preferences in user profile model (backend/models/) or an HR settings endpoint.
